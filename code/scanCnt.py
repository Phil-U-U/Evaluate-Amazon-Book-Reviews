It introduces a novice to the foundational concepts of computer science. There are many great examples and activities that the reader can jump into almost immediately. I had already written my first Python program after 10 minutes of reading.'
    s2 = "I'm rather new to CS, am a major in it as well. I dabble in various languages, which range from: Python to PHP to MooTools. This book teaches you theoretical computer science concepts as well as the art of programming via Python 3. It doesn't have a ton of pages and it executes its goal very well, which is to introduce students to the field of computer science and to focus on problem solving instead of complicated syntax and compiler issues. The programs are very mathematically based and it's a bit tedious (I find most technical subjects are), but the examples are fascinating if you love the idea of what can be computed. You'll broaden your mind and be ready to dive into actual programming after doing the exercises in this book."

I emailed Dr. Zelle (the author) with a couple of questions and he responded quickly and was quite helpful. What more could you possibly ask for? An affordable text book, you say? Look no further! At this price and with these features, you simply CAN'T GO WRONG!!!"
